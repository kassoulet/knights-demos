A small naive intro just made for fun.



--- COMPILING ---

'./configure && make' will do the job
if './configure' doesn't work, try to generate it with './autogen.sh'

configure options:
	--enable-debug 	disable optimisations and stripping
	--enable-mikmod	use mikmod instead of minifmod (for non-x86, needs SDL)
	--disable-sdl	use the custom win32 renderer (not using sdl.dll)

--- NEEDED ---

all: 	You must have SDL installed, even when compiling the win32 version.
	You need nasm in order to compile minifmod.

win32: MINGW+MSYS+MSYS DTK to compile.

--- NOTES --- 

Some infos on structure:

src/data contains data added into the intro.
src/data/src contains the editable data. 
run the 'convert' in this folder to convert data to src/data source files.
the music is a fasttracker2 .xm module.
images are 8bpp .bmp, 127 colors maxi.
