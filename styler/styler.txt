             !! Apparently MIDAS 1.1.x don't work on the GUS Max & PnP
             !! So use a Sound Blaster to get sound

  .Billou.
             Do not run it under windows, it's slower, you don't get correct
             sync'ing and DO NEVER start it in windowed mode, this will crash
             your PC to Hell...

             Run _Perfectly_ with a Pentium 100.

             This is the final version.
             In party version, you must reset if you enter in sound setup.
             [Sorry. :(]

             we use the allegro 3D engine... Our engine is 4 times faster,
             but unfinished...

             This demo has no _real_ ending, I'm too lasy, and there was a
             deadline. :(
